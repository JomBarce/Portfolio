# Portfolio Website

I created this portfolio to replace my simple, static site with something that reflects my skills as a developer. This custom website combines 3D graphics, interactive animations, and dynamic content, offering a unique, engaging experience.

The site features smooth transitions, a 3D background powered by Three.js, and custom GLSL shaders to showcase my work in a visually dynamic way. Beyond just listing projects, this portfolio demonstrates my ability to create immersive web experiences with JavaScript, animation, and 3D graphics.

This site isn’t just about what I’ve built; it’s about how I build and the attention to detail I bring to every project.
